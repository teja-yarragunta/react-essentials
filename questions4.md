1. In what way are React components meant to be "pure functions"

- Given the same props or state, the component will always return
  the same content, or UI
- Rendering and re-rendering a component will never have any kind
  of side effect on an outside system

2. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?

- Any code that affects or interacts with an outside system
- local storage, API, websockets, DOM manipulation

3. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?

- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with data,
  rendering DOM elements

4. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?

- As soon as the component renders for the first time
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders

5. How would you explain what the "dependencies array" is?

- Second parameter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether or not it should re-run the effect function
